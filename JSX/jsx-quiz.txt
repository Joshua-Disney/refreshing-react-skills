let skateboardDog = (
  <img src="alfie.jpg" />
  <h1>Hiya kids!  I'm a dog on a skateboard.</h1>

8: Can a web browser read JSX directly?

Answer: Correct! JSX is compiled to code read-able by a browser.


9: What problem does the virtual DOM attempt to solve?

Answer: Correct! Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because it finds out exactly which objects have changed, and only those objects get updated on the DOM.
